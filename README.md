## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I had the chance to pratice CSS and my flexbox skills. I had a good experience with background image positioning. 


### Continued development

But i'm not satisfied with my result on this challenge. The position of background images was a bit tricky and i didn't found a fix to adapt the images in different resolutions(i could use media queries, but i want to find another way to solve it).
